# PPCombine

# what is?
PPCombine allows multiple powerpoints to be queued for playback. When started, the powerpoint is started. 

Using the arrow keys or next/prev buttons, the slides can be displayed.

Once all slides of one powerpoint have been viewed, the application will seemlessly show the first slide of the next powerpoint.


# how to use?
Install using the setup executable in the install folder.

If you update, please remove the old version first in your programs

Make sure that powerpoint is installed on your computer!

On powerpoint itself, you can set the output screen before you initiate this program.


Use the add pptx button to add a powerpoint to the list of powerpoints. 

Press start to start the first powerpoint. 

Select a slide in the slide overview and press goto to open this slide.
